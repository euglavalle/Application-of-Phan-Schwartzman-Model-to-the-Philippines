# Application-of-the-Phan-Schwartzman-Model-to-the-Philippines
This repository contains the code used to apply the Phan-Schwartzman model to the Philippines.

Most of the code used, is the original code developed by To√†n Phan and Felipe Schwartzman in their paper **Climate defaults and financial adaptation** (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2024.104866). Only the adapted scripts are provided here. 

To reproduce the results, the original code should be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tyxf9v4fi9be4q4yka529/Replication_EER_final.zip?rlkey=jknn7mz4hayzrf8sj6csio3rv&e=1&dl=0. This link is found on https://toan.myportfolio.com/econ.
